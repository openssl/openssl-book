Overview
========

The OpenSSL Guide is an attempt to create better documentation for the OpenSSL
Toolkit. Until now the following types of documentation exist:

1) Man pages
2) Wiki

The man pages are a reference guide and useful for looking up the specific usage
of a particular command or function. The wiki is a an unreviewed community
resource which may contain content on a wide range of subjects. Typically this
content is relatively short and focussed on a particular subject area. The wiki
is intended to have a relatively low barrier of entry to encourage community
collaboration.

This book is intended to fill a "gap" in this documentation, i.e. to provide a
definitive, trusted source of introductory and "guide" style material that will
enable a reader who is unfamiliar with OpenSSL to learn more about it. It will
contain content that should enable the reader to get to a level of familiarity
with OpenSSL that they can then use the other documentation sources (such as the
man pages) to find detailed information as required.

NOTE: This is a very initial draft and there is no content in the guide yet!

Building the OpenSSL Guide
==========================

The following prerequisites are needed in order to build the guide:

- TeX Live
- gcc
- make

Assuming you have all of the above installed on your system, then creating the
guide is simply a matter of typing "make" from the command line:

 $ make

 The output should be "openssl-book.pdf".
