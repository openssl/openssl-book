Overview
========

The OpenSSL Guide is an attempt to create better documentation for the OpenSSL
Toolkit. Until now the following types of documentation exist:

1) Man pages
2) Wiki

The man pages are a reference guide and useful for looking up the specific usage
of a particular command or function. The wiki is a an unreviewed community
resource which may contain content on a wide range of subjects. Typically this
content is relatively short and focussed on a particular subject area. The wiki
is intended to have a relatively low barrier of entry to encourage community
collaboration.

This book is intended to fill a "gap" in this documentation, i.e. to provide a
definitive, trusted source of introductory and "guide" style material that will
enable a reader who is unfamiliar with OpenSSL to learn more about it. It will
contain content that should enable the reader to get to a level of familiarity
with OpenSSL that they can then use the other documentation sources (such as the
man pages) to find detailed information as required.

The latest draft of the book is available at:
https://openssl.github.io/openssl-book/openssl-book.pdf

NOTE: This is a very initial draft and there is no content in the guide yet!

Building the OpenSSL Guide
==========================

The following prerequisites are needed in order to build the guide:

- TeX Live
- gcc
- make

Assuming you have all of the above installed on your system, then creating the
guide is simply a matter of typing "make" from the command line:

 $ make

 The output should be "openssl-book.pdf".
